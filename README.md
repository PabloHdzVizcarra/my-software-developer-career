# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer.
Maintaining a record of our progress is invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 1646-47-48-49 Completed ReactJS Course

During these days I completed the ReactJS course, I have been working on this course for around two-three weeks, working on the course I refresh my ReactJs knowledge and learned new things. I am excited about my new project, tomorrow I will need to think and start a new project to practice all the knowledge learned.

### Day 1645 Search Functionality

Today I have been working on a search functionality in the course application, the idea is to create a search bar that look for elements in the database through a query.

### Day 1644 Managing React State

Today working in some ReactJS code finally something make click in my  mind and I could start to think in ReactJS statement components in a more effectively way, state is like a properties in classes, you can create code variables in the component, but this code variables are scoped like a variables created in a method execution, and to persist this value to be reusable by other components you require the state, you can link components and classes with this analogy.

### Day 1643 Render Components Conditionally

Today I have been studying different techniques to render ReactJS components conditionally. I need to apply some logic to render X component for an authenticated user and another component for non-authenticated users. ReactJS is beautiful, but it's just JavaScript/TypeScript code, and with a good software engineering background, any JavaScript frontend framework can be easy to work with. However the magic in frontend development comes from CSS.

### Day 1641-42 useEffect Hook

I studied with more dive how works the useEffect ReactJS hook, also I studied a little how ReactJs manage the status update in the application.

### Day 1639-40 Continue Learning ReactJS and UI

These days I have been doing my MERN course, I have been learning basic style techniques to add styles to my ReactJS components. Creating ReactJS components can be a tricky activity, is the same like backend development you can create a mess of TS/JS code. It's funny for the moment.

### Day 1638 Managing Files with JavaScript and NodeJS

Today I was working on a piece of code that needs to read a CSV file, validate the correct CSV file structure to finally parse the CSV into a database. I am having some problems to learn how to use the Javascript APIS for handling files, specially learn how to use async/await code with this.

### Day 1637 Firestore

Today I learned how to upload files to firestore with JavaScript code, I created a basic application functionality that uploads images files from the user. Also I learned some of the JavaScript/NodeJS APIs to manipulate files. JavaScript have a basic APIs to manage the disk storage in the application this is my personal opinion I felt limited working with this rather than Java or Python code.

### Day 1635-36 Implementing Google OAuth

During these days, I have been working on my MERN course. I am learning how to implement an OAuth login with google using [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) and authentication functionalities. I builded the Sign In and Sign Up pages in the frontend currently I am working on implement the sing in google functionality in the backend.

### Day 1633-34 HTMX and Frontend Technologies

During the weekend, I continued studying more about Frontend technologies. I started an O'Reilly MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) course to further improve my frontend skills. You can find the course [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/full-stack-mern/9781835461686/). Additionally, I began exploring [HTMX](https://htmx.org), a library designed to build interactive web applications similar to ReactJS. I found working with HTMX to be enjoyable and it has been a great resource for learning more about Golang, as I created a basic web application with a form and managed the backend with Golang.

### Day 1632 TypeScript and NodeJS

Today, I am continuing to create Node.js and React.js applications to further improve my full-stack developer skills. My focus is on understanding how to create and maintain robust full-stack applications. Currently, I am prioritizing the development of logic and communication in the frontend using React.js and Next.js. While I am not currently focusing on website design, I am dedicated to honing my skills in building the functionality and interactivity of applications.

### Day 1630-31 Backend Communication Patterns

During these days, I continue studying communication patterns in client-server connections. The reason for studying this is that I am currently working on a full-stack application. This project is a challenge for me because, in the past, I focused on creating FrontEnd applications using ReactJS and Angular. However, my knowledge in these areas is still at a basic level. Working as a Full Stack developer is rewarding but also exhausting. I recognize that I need to continue learning more about full-stack development and client-server applications.

### Day 1628-29 Register Users and Authentication

I am working on implement an user registration routes for my application, the idea is that any user can register in the server with their data, and with this data registered, now clients can create applications to fetch this user information.

### Day 1625-26-27 Finished the Linux Command Line Book

Over the weekend, I completed reading the Linux Command Line book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, especially the section on increasing productivity using the terminal for common and repetitive tasks. After finishing the book, I started a new project: building my own implementation of the OAuth standard using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript for learning purposes. My goal is to practice TypeScript and refresh my knowledge of client-server communication. As a first step, I will dive into understanding how the OAuth standard works while documenting my journey in a Medium blog post. Of course, I will follow the Test-Driven Development methodology in developing this application.

### Day 1624 Continue with Bash

Today I continue reading the Linux Command Line book. I learned about how to debug bash scripts and how bash manage syntax errors.

### Day 1623 Bash Loops

Today I learned how to use loops in bash like while, for and until. Bash is a funny language if you want to interact with the OS system in my case MacOS, I created some scripts to learn and practice control flow in bash scripts. An interesting script created today was a script that reads the content of a file line by line and column by colum.

### Day 1618-19-20-21-22 Finishing NextJS Application

These days I have been working to complete the NextJS application tutorial. I could completed the tutorial and deploy the application in Vercel, the application looks good and work as expected. I discovery something studying about the IBM Carbon Design System, I don't like the Frontend technologies related with the style like SASS and other tyke of obscure technologies. The problem with styling the frontend is you need to understand all the technologies available and select the best for your project.

### Day 1617 UI Styles

Today, I've been applying UI designs to a Next.js component. Reflecting on the past, I recall that one reason I used to dislike Frontend work was due to design and CSS. Frankly, it's not my favorite aspect. Nevertheless, I recognize the importance of this task and am committed to improving in this area. As a Full Stack developer, I find it fulfilling to work on complete projects independently.

### Day 1615-16 NextJS and Unit Testing

Unit testing in front end applications is a funny task for me, I love to test my UI components, it's funny work with logic in the UI, some of my unit testing backend techniques can be applied to the frontend. React properties in components are like dependency injection in backend code.

### Day 1614 OpenID Connect and NodeJS HTTPS Server

Today I have been learning how works the OpenID Connect protocol, I needed to learn how to implement this protocol with NodeJS and Typescript, my weekend goal is learn how to implement this protocol with a Go application. Also, I needed to learn how to create a HTTPS server on my local machine with NodeJS and Express application.

### Day 1609-10-11-12-13 NextJS Application

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into a Next.js tutorial [you can find it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5cmLDVTgAs&t=12330s). In this tutorial, Iâ€™m not only refreshing my ReactJS knowledge but also exploring the exciting world of Next.js.

In the past, Iâ€™ve developed several Full Stack applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS). Working on those projects was quite enjoyable. While the UI designs were intentionally kept simple and clean, I made sure to incorporate Unit Testing into the applications. I have a soft spot for creating FrontEnd applications using the TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology.

Now, I find myself revisiting FrontEnd technologies because Iâ€™m currently working on a frontend application in my current job. Itâ€™s fascinating how technology keeps evolving, isnâ€™t it? ðŸš€.

### Day 1607-08 More Frontend

I continue studying more about Frontend technologies, I am doing a NextJS tutorial to learn the recent frontend technologies, In the past I learned and created interesting ReactJS applications, with MERN stack, I want to learn how to use ReactJs 18 and NextJS to build some basic applications, for the moment I am in the bom moment, when you start to remember a technology learned on the past.

### Day 1602-03-04-05-06 Back to the Frontend

These days I have been studying about Frontend technologies, like ReactJS, TypeScript, NPM and NextJS. On my first days learning programming I started with Javascript, ReactJS and NodeJS I have a lot of fun making some full stack applications, really I loved these times, I needed to start to study again frontend technologies because on my current job I started to work with ReactJS and NodeJS for a full stack application. I paused my Linux study for a moment to focus on this.

### Day 1601 Continue Linux Scripting

Today I have been learning more about Linux scripts, I was studying the test expressions in bash and how works flow conditional statements like if/else on bash. It is interesting how bash works.
