# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer.
Maintaining a record of our progress is invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

### Programming Changes My Life

#### Day 1464 Clean Agile

Today I have been continuing reading the Clean Agile book, this book is amazing.
I love the next message about practice TDD:
We practice TDD because it gives us the courage to keep the code clean and orderly.
It gives us the courage to act like professionals.

#### Day 1463 Looking for More New Java Features

Today I am studying about the nex Java ecosystem like GrailVM and trying to build a native image. I had some 
problems with maven about compiling the project, its amazing when you only use Spring Boot for all your projects, 
how building an application from scratch can be arduous at the start.

#### Day 1462 Sealed Classes

Today I began to study the new features that arrive with Java 17 and Java 21, I am not studying about the new Java 
features, and I have the goal to obtain the Java 17 Developer certification next year.

#### Day 1461 Kotlin Cronjob

Today I have been learning how to create a Cronjob application with Kotlin.
I will need to use a JVM library to create the cronjob functionality.
The application was easy only execute a short task every hour, the idea was created the application to run in a Docker
container.

#### Day 1458-59-60 Finish to Read Head-First Design Patterns Book

On the weekend I finished reading the Head-First Design Patterns. 
It took me three months to complete it.
During my journey, I learned a lot about design patterns and Java. 
I really love the Head-First books because they offer a lot of examples, and you can read the book in an interactive way.
I learned some new things about Java and Design Patterns, and also gained more knowledge in Software Design principles 
like SOLID principles.

#### Day 1457 Learning More About Design Patterns

Today I had been learning more about design patterns.
The last of the Head-First Design Patterns book talks about what is a pattern, what is a pattern catalog, etc.
I am learning general concepts about Design Patterns.
Also, I started a new book lecture, this time I choose the Clean Agile book, I am always trying to read two books at
the same time, one book related a code (read the book sitting in front of my laptop) and other book that I can read in
any place like the commute to my work.

#### Day 1456 Finish MVC Pattern Study

Today I completed my study of the MVC design pattern.
Now, I understand that the MVC pattern is intricately woven with other patterns such as Strategy, Observer, and Adapter.
I recall studying the MVC pattern during my exploration of Angular.
It fascinated me because Angular's framework incorporates this pattern at its core.

#### Day 1455 Studying the MVC pattern

Today I studied the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
Now I know that the MVC pattern is composed of other patterns like the Observer and Strategy patterns.
I am building a Java Swing application following a book tutorial to understand the MVC pattern.
Learning about Java Swing is a pleasure for me because it is a great technology to create desktop applications.
Maybe when I finish this book, I will learn more about Java Swing.

#### Day 1454 Compound Patterns

Today I am creating a basic application following a tutorial.
The application implements six different design patterns like Adapter and Observer.
My next thing to study is MVC(Model View Controller) design pattern; I hope that this time studying the MVC pattern
will be less difficult that the other times and I can understand in a better way.

#### Day 1451-52-53 The Proxy Pattern

These days I continue to read the Head-First Design Patterns book.
The **Proxy** pattern is a great tool for our design box; I remember in the past that I could see some proxy
implementations, but I don't know that this type of implementing the code has a name.
Basic description: The Proxy pattern protects the access to an object and next surrogate the calls to the real object.
