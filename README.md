# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository, I will keep the progress of my career as a software engineer. I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming, I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Changes My Life

#### Day 1428 Java Artifacts

Today I have needed to investigate how to create a Java library with a basic functionality like parse a String to 
a CamelCase style, then package the library in a Jar Java artifact and upload the Java artifact into a Maven 
repository, the final step is use this previous library created into a new Java project. 

#### Day 1427 Command Pattern

Today I have studied the Command design pattern, in the past I cannot find a real use case for use the command
pattern, well, I cannot understand the command pattern in a good way, but now studying and practicing more and applying
TDD with the book lecture I am understanding the command pattern better.
The easy definition of the command patter is, you have an object called command in this command object you can
store a receiver this receiver needs to know how to execute the command, and you have another object called invoker,
the invoker has the responsibility to execute the command.

#### Day 1426 Back to Work

Today, I returned from my vacation to work, and my first day back brought several changes to the team.
I managed to complete some Java code tasks at work.
Now, I need to establish a new routine for my life
and ensure that I prioritize activities that will positively impact my career.

#### Day 1425 End of Vacation

Well, today my month vacation was completed,
I cannot achieve my career goals in my vacation days like finish reading the head-first design Patterns book,
but I continue reading two books making some Java code for book exercises.
My most important challenge to complete in my vacation was my change of home activity,
I need to move from a different city to work in the office at least two days each week.

#### Day 1413 Dependency Inversion

Today I started to study the dependency inversion principle.
In the past I studied the principle without understanding in a good way,
but now I want to gain a great acknowledgement about this.
Some things continue obscure in my mind about Object-Oriented programming and clean code.

#### Day 1412 Factory Method Pattern

Today I have studied the factory method pattern.
In the past, when I studied this design pattern, I had some doubts about how it works or in which real-life scenarios
can be useful.
I don't know that you can see the Factory Method pattern as a framework to create a family of objects related to a type.
