# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 1012 Read and read

Today I was read a lot of the book Building Microservices, this book is a great tool to understand you how to can
create a good microservices.

##### Day 1011 You need an organization task tool

Yes I think that all programmers need an organization task tool for your personal learning, sometimes when I read a
book an interesting concept appear, and you want to learn more about this concept, and if you have a tool when you
have a record of your progress can be help you to see your old progress and says I learn a lot of things in this
point.

##### Day 1010 Microservice Communication

The communication in microservices is one of the most important things that you decide when you build a microservice,
async or sync the most common types of communication, well At this moment I have a problem with an async messages
flow, I feel that my head its crazy, I think that this is one of the most difficult parts in programming,
asynchronous I go for you.

##### Day 1009 Oh My Back and Happy Birthday

I remember this scene of the movie Spider-Man, and it's funny At this moment, only to say that I have a big pain in my
back.

##### Day 1008 Estimations

Today I make another estimation for a new feature in the platform, I think that my estimations times its be better with
the time, and I hope finish this feature in the time estimated.

##### Day 1007 WebHooks and Microservices

Today I learned some interesting things about microservices, how to separate responsibilities for
them and how to think better when creating microservices.

##### Day 1006 Scala and JVM

This weekend I was study Scala programming language, how Scala is a language part of the JVM I am
interesting learn for funny reasons, well functional programming is strange with Scala.

##### Day 1005 A Lot of Events

I do an infinite for loop in Kafka today, this is not my intention, but I learn some interesting
things about how Kafka handle the messages in topics and group ids.

##### Day 1004 Wake Up Early

In the calm when it's morning all city is in state of peace, and I can do code with a great
pleasure,
I enjoy these moments.

##### Day 1003 When Things Work Out

Sometimes some things work a good, but another work bad, maybe you think that your solution it's
good, but in the testing its bad in this point you think that you are a bad programmer, wait a
moment and relax, your travel is begun start just now, only enjoy the travel.

##### Day 1002 Asynchronous Thinking

I think that little by little I am understanding asynchronous, I think I just need more practice
and knowledge.

##### Day 1001 Kafka and Kubernetes

This of Kafka and Kubernetes is a big problem, how you make that all events are handle and
controlled this is a challenge, I have few days for finish this feature.
