# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 1267 Software Development Flow

Today I continue to designing my best software development flow. When I start any type of project, I need to apply to
TDD in all the software development process, also I recommend that you create the documentation at the same time and any
type of diagram that you want to add to the project. Please improve the GitHub Readme, create good commits and create
documentation about the process.

##### Day 1266 Forgetting Logs

When you write any code, method, class or process, please don't forget to add some logs. The importance of add logs in
any application is great, because all the time you need know what do you the application, and well when you have debug
production problems you will suffer a lot when trying to discover where is the issue. Trust me stop and add logs in the
key parts of the application, important logs.

##### Day 1263,64,65 Reading

I continue reading the Security Engineering book, really I need to finish this book, I have a deadline to April 1 to
finish this lecture, I don't have desire to continue reading this book, but I need to finish. When I finish this book my
next goal is finish my RedHat Developer Certification.

##### Day 1262 Java 20

Today I review the new features in Java 20, I have a lot of problems with try to execute the code in IntelliJ, I need to
do some configurations steps before compile and run the code. Also, I continue reading the Security Engineering book.

##### Day 1261 Scoped Values

Today I watch the Java First, Java Always YouTube video, well Java is doing a great a job with involve the community
with this type of videos. I learn about the Scoped Values JEP is interesting how Java continue to evolving and I think
that Scoped Values is a great tool in concurrency problems I remember my errors with some threads executions and modify
variables values with wrong data.

##### Day 1258-59-60 CQRS

These days I have learned about the CQRS Microservice Pattern and build a basic application following a YouTube
tutorial. I found my focus again I stop to learn Scala for the moment and continue to improve my Java skill, 2023 is the
year in which I need to obtain my Java Developer Certification by Oracle, and I need to continue to practice Java.

##### Day 1256-1257 Mac

Today I start with the macOS ecosystems, I buy a MacBook Air my first impressions are great, because I can start to
install all my Java ecosystem with the terminal using SDK man I spend my time today customize my laptop, and write some
basic Java code. The M1 apple chip looks like fine, IntelliJ run fast, I hope that this laptop have a great performance
and use in my future learnings.

##### Day 1255 Grit

I continue reading my security book, but I need to say this I hate this book now, is very large, very, very large, I
don't want to continue to reading anymore, but I know that all this knowledge acquired with this book is a good thing
for my software developer career in this point the Grit is coming. I have two options, to finish my book or leave it.
Well, I decide this tomorrow.

##### Day 1254 SSH

Today I read the documentation about SHH and I need to remember how the certificates works, also I notice that I am
putting less attention in my work, this is bad because I need to upgrade my skills rather than downgrade them. I need to
focus on my details and remember why is the reason that I am a programmer.
