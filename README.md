# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 909 Free Day

After having some difficult days and a lot fo work I have relaxed a little this day I have coded a little, but the desire to code has continued with me all day, guys after spending twenty hours coding take a break.

##### Day 904 Having A Hard Time

I have had a couple of bad days at work, I seem to take a long time to solve the problems, I don't like at all to fix one thing but another one has an error, I need to take it easy and see all possible options.

##### Day 903 The Phrase If It Works Don't Touch It

lately we have had many problems at work with functionalities that work and after some changes they no longer work correctly.

##### Day 899 Problems With Cron Tasks

The actual problem is you have a cron tasks that executes each minute, but you hvae ten instances of this program yes now you have ten cron tasks thats executes each minutos, solution a unique instance of this program or use a queue, Kubernetes  I love it but with your autoscaling I have problems.

##### Day 897 Working a lot

This days I am working a lot, more than 12 hours daylies I am tired, but I learn a lot of things.

##### Day 894 Object-Design

The object-oriented programming i like much, I think that is an one of this things that any developer should been a good understand, any thing in this world is an object, only think this

##### Day 893 More About Design Patterns

Today I study about the strategy pattern I build a basic API  to buy books in a ecommerce app, well it's not finished yet, but tomorrow finish with this app.

##### Day 892 Containers

Things like docker and kubernetes I quite like, they are a bit difficult to learn at first but once you get the hang of them you don't want to stop using them.

##### Day 891 Multithread
The concurrency in applications it's an important part, in microservices I think that this is crucial and hard to understand to start with, currently we have problems with transactions this weekend need to study this topic.

##### Day 890 Database Index

Today I learned about the indexes in the database, I had no idea what a composite index is, until today that I started to investigate also went to a vaccine for COVID-19 a disease that became epidemic well I think that coding and being unhealthy is not a good idea ....

##### Day 889 Apple Forms

Today I have started a new development where I will have to integrate an Apple API, I feel a little bit afraid because it is a development with a deadline and I don't want to look bad.

##### Day 888 Fix Bugs

Today I solved some bugs in my work these bugs see easy but in the practice was more complicated that start, tomorrow I start with new development I am exciting.

##### Day 887 State Pattern

Today I was studying design patterns, this day studied the State Design Pattern, the design patterns, and very interesting, my object-oriented code it's poorly about design, I want to be better with object-oriented programming and Java and Kotlin languages for the moment. 

##### Day 885|886 Design Patterns

I start to read the design patterns book, I think that this book it's hard to read, object-oriented programming is hard, but it's amazing.

##### Day 884 Don't Work

I have a big problem with the development of one application, I have two days fixing a bug but I can't be fixed, the programming sometimes it's bad.

##### Day 883 Think Async

In this days all things are Async, the company number one in microservices called Netflix contribute a lot to the community,  in my work we use microservices architecture each day I leanr more things about this topic

##### Day 882 Magic Times

I think that in my work the time to finish one task is very short, I have some issues to fix, but I can't because they preferred that I release new developments. 

##### Day 881 Alter PostgreSQL Database

Today I had to alter a table in postgresql, it is something that I had never done before and although I only altered it in the dev environment I know that my script will be executed in the production database that causes me some fear, and if I break the whole system? well I guess these things happen to all developers.

##### Day 880 Port 8080

Today finish read another book, The Clean Coder the book is amazing I was thinking that some 
problems can resolve reading this book, one of the most interesting part is Estimation, yeah I 
have some problems with the estimations times, and now I will think two times before I say I 
can do this for tomorrow.

##### Day 879 The Right Way

I think that the right way to make code doesn't exist, I like development code with technique 
TDD (Test Drive Development), like the Object-Oriented Programming, like read a lot but the most 
important thing is this career I think is never stop learning.

##### Day 878 Complicating My Life

I start to see how the live can be complicated if your try split your time and learn many things at
the same time, I thought that this is productive but this is not the way to get better results, I
think that have three primary things will learn , Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented
Programming and English.

##### Day 877 Handle Time

My mission, change the timezone in a Kubernetes Pod yes the Pod don't handle the same timezone that
the application, the events handled by time doesn't work, I don't like the idea about set the
timezone in Mexico City the UTC is the universal standard, well I just follow orders.

##### Day 876 Make Magic

literal I need to make magic, I have a task very hard, I don't idea about how to make it, I think
that sleep refresh my mind tomorrow need start with this problem.

##### Day 875 The Power of Comma

I have an error in Jenkins file because I don't remember add a comma at the end of the variable and
the IDE don't help me with the warnings, it is funny how a deployment can be cancelled with this
little error.

##### Day 874 Remember KISS

Today I spent a lot of time trying to build code with best practices but in the end, I remember to
keep simple the code, well-learned lessons for the next time.

##### Day 873 Reading a Lot

I could say that today I read all day, read a lot of pages of a book and some post blogs in Medium
the Sundays I like read a lot, clean my workspace and apply maintenance for my pc.

##### Day 872 The Clean Coder

I started reading this book, I hope to learn how to improve as a developer with this reading.

##### Day 871 Dreaming With Code

Please take notes about your pending tasks in any place for example paper or a todo list, I didn't
believe this, but I need a place where I take out all tasks from my brain.

##### Day 870 Developing Estimates

Estimates a confusing word, today I had to elaborate several estimates for some new functionalities,
due to my little experience in the working world and my little knowledge this part was very
difficult for me but well to elaborate things as fast as possible without forgetting the
requirements and the quality of the code.

##### Day 869 Docker and Kubernetes

In the job we start to work with kubernetes this is amazing, I like docker and kubernetes.

##### Day 868 I Am Tired

Yesterday I was tired from my job, this is the reason that I don't write anything, Today I have a
good day at my job, yet I don't solve the issues in the code, but I was working more comfortably,
don't work extra hours my advice.

##### Day 866 Reactive Life

The reactive programming is amazing, I need learn this concepts because in my job use architecture
based on events by Kafka and I need best understand how works all this, the life is good I like be
programmer.

##### Day 865 Devops Culture

I was thinking that only I make the code and another person has the responsibility to deploy my
code, that is great but this is not the case I need to learn some concepts about deploying
applications in multiple environments, I love docker for these purposes.

##### Day 864 Environment Problems

Today I have witnessed the problems with the development environment works in this one but not in
that ine, it is a difficult situation, but I really like the feeling of having to solve a problem
and not having any idea how to do it.

##### Day 863 Simple Bugs

Today was a somewhat exhausting day, we had two deployments to production of which one good and one
bad, I am a bit sad to see that the errors were only environment settings for the productive
environment, I will pay more attention to those details next time, tip guys pay attention to the
smallest details.

##### Day 862 Reactive and Kafka It's Good

Today I learned more concepts about Reactive programming and Java with the all knowledge that I am
learned think that can improve a lot of things in my current job, really it's another world.

##### Day 861 The Power of For Loop

Today I was handled with a loop with more than 50k of data, the algorithm finished in BigO(n) I
think that I can get more speed the time of execution I don't like more than 10 seconds, it's a lot
of time.

#### Day 860 Being Productive

Today I was solved three bugs in my job, well I start be productive, it's amazing how the study
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) can help you in your job thanks for this tip Utsav you are my
mentor.

#### Day 858 | 859 Learning About Reactive Programming

In the job we have a problem, we need process three TPS(Transaction Per Second) in a service but
currently only we support less than two TPS, if I managed to fulfill this purpose I think I can call
myself a software engineer well only I think.

#### Day 857 I Have It

I think that one of the most difficult things that I have encountered until today is to learn to
read code, I mean to understand the code that I am reading, to understand a long method, what it
does, how it does it, I just hope that as the days go by this skill will improve a lot in me.

#### Day 856 Some Problems

Programming is difficult, to understand code that has many lines is very difficult, not to get lost
in a method with more than three hundred lines is complicated, today we had problems with
concurrency and TPS in the code, I have to reinforce these issues.

#### Day 854|855 Ready to Production

Today I make a war file with a fix for bug to deploy in production, well all is ok too I learned
about concurrency in execution time, I have to find the way to have a count and can stop and resume
this tasks.

#### Day 853 Coding With Testing

I had forgotten the feeling that is coding with test, having that layer of security that test or you
that everything is right or wrong, today I learned a great lesson no matter how short the deadliness
are do not forget the unit test friends will save your life.

#### Day 852 Testing is Beautiful

The security that is gained by working with TDD or test is unmatched, maybe you feel slower because
you create the test at the same time as the development of the code, but you get great benefits, I
had days that I did not feel calm working, I want to write lines and lines of code.

#### Day 851 Ending The Legacy Code

In my current job all day I work with legacy code, this day's try to evade this code, but think that
is impossible, so started reading the Working With Legacy Code book, even if you go for this first
chapters the book is very helpful really all people that work with legacy code must be read, need be
better in my job, need be a productive programmer.
