# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think
it is very important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started
programming I wanted to have a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have
taken and this repository is the result of that record.

#### Day 758 Java | Hibernate | SpringBoot | MySQL

I learn some things, javax.validation annotations with hibernate validator are beautiful, spring has an implementation for javax.validation is easy to validate fields with spring, I understand Bean validation and rules to validation in MySQL 

#### Day 757 Java | SpringBoot
Finish another endpoint to my API, tomorrow I continue to document this API.

#### Day 756 Java | Read

All today I was read an object thinking book and learned more about concepts of object-oriented programming, I continue to develop the front end to my API but I think that finished using swagger for this purpose

#### Day 755 Java | React JS

Starting with the front end to API, this project is built with React JS, Typescript, and Docosaurus, I like that anyone people can use this API to build their projects.

#### Day 754 Java | SpringBooot | Hibernate

Hibernate and spring boot has me tired, finished endpoint to save data and start endpoint to fetch data, but I have some bugs with this purpose, well my first job how a software engineer is coming soon.

#### Day 753 Java | Hibernate | Swagger

Today have multiple problems, some problems with hibernate and SQL relationships, learning differences between saving data identified for Long or UUID in MySQL, can't fix swagger for my API, I wrote a few tests for my code, this is a not good day, I am tired of now.


#### Day 752

Today continue learning docosaurus to document my API, I haven't used React JS for 
some time, Try document my API with Swagger, but I have some bugs with SpringBoot.

#### Day 751

Today finish authentication for my personal project, authentication based of username and
password using Spring Security and JsonWebToken and start the documentation for my
project. The idea is any users, can use my API.
