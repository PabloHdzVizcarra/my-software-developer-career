# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 868 I Am Tired

Yesterday I was tired from my job, this is the reason that I don't write anything, Today I have a good day at my job yet I don't cant solve the issues in the code but I was working more comfortably, don't work extra hours my advice.

##### Day 866 Reactive Life

The reactive programming is amazing, I need learn this concepts because in my job use architecture
based on events by Kafka and I need best understand how works all this, the life is good I like be
programmer.

##### Day 865 Devops Culture

I was thinking that only I make the code and another person has the responsibility to deploy my
code, that is great but this is not the case I need to learn some concepts about deploying
applications in multiple environments, I love docker for these purposes.

##### Day 864 Environment Problems

Today I have witnessed the problems with the development environment works in this one but not in
that ine, it is a difficult situation, but I really like the feeling of having to solve a problem
and not having any idea how to do it.

##### Day 863 Simple Bugs

Today was a somewhat exhausting day, we had two deployments to production of which one good and one
bad, I am a bit sad to see that the errors were only environment settings for the productive
environment, I will pay more attention to those details next time, tip guys pay attention to the
smallest details.

##### Day 862 Reactive and Kafka It's Good

Today I learned more concepts about Reactive programming and Java with the all knowledge that I am
learned think that can improve a lot of things in my current job, really it's another world.

##### Day 861 The Power of For Loop

Today I was handled with a loop with more than 50k of data, the algorithm finished in BigO(n) I
think that I can get more speed the time of execution I don't like more than 10 seconds, it's a lot
of time.

#### Day 860 Being Productive

Today I was solved three bugs in my job, well I start be productive, it's amazing how the study
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) can help you in your job thanks for this tip Utsav you are my
mentor.

#### Day 858 | 859 Learning About Reactive Programming

In the job we have a problem, we need process three TPS(Transaction Per Second) in a service but
currently only we support less than two TPS, if I managed to fulfill this purpose I think I can call
myself a software engineer well only I think.

#### Day 857 I Have It

I think that one of the most difficult things that I have encountered until today is to learn to
read code, I mean to understand the code that I am reading, to understand a long method, what it
does, how it does it, I just hope that as the days go by this skill will improve a lot in me.

#### Day 856 Some Problems

Programming is difficult, to understand code that has many lines is very difficult, not to get lost
in a method with more than three hundred lines is complicated, today we had problems with
concurrency and TPS in the code, I have to reinforce these issues.

#### Day 854|855 Ready to Production

Today I make a war file with a fix for bug to deploy in production, well all is ok too I learned
about concurrency in execution time, I have to find the way to have a count and can stop and resume
this tasks.

#### Day 853 Coding With Testing

I had forgotten the feeling that is coding with test, having that layer of security that test or you
that everything is right or wrong, today I learned a great lesson no matter how short the deadliness
are do not forget the unit test friends will save your life.

#### Day 852 Testing is Beautiful

The security that is gained by working with TDD or test is unmatched, maybe you feel slower because
you create the test at the same time as the development of the code, but you get great benefits, I
had days that I did not feel calm working, I want to write lines and lines of code.

#### Day 851 Ending The Legacy Code

In my current job all day I work with legacy code, this day's try to evade this code, but think that
is impossible, so started reading the Working With Legacy Code book, even if you go for this first
chapters the book is very helpful really all people that work with legacy code must be read, need be
better in my job, need be a productive programmer.
