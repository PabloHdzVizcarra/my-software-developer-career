# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 1169 Managing Stress Situations

Today I have a very stress situation in my work, and this is because about my lack in English. I think that I have improved my English a lot but at this moment is not very good to have a conversation with USA people. Definitely English is my main goal the next year, though Java Developer certification is important too.

##### Day 1168 Python and CSV

Today, I learn more about pandas library, In the work we use a lot of information storage in CSV files. I want to be more Agile for example, I need to check all the elements in this CSV that have this ID. Tomorrow I want to explore another library for this purpose in Java called Tableu.

##### Day 1167 Study More English

I decide that in the end of the year I need a relax about study computer science things, and for this reason I will focus to improve my English. In my work in these moments, I have some meetings with native English speakers, and it is frustrating don't understand them very well. Also, I start to write Java tutorials one each week, I hope that in the next year I feel more comfortable with the English language. 

##### Day 1165-1166 New certificate and Other Java Tutorial.

Saturday I complete my course about Containers and Kubernetes, I do the test and approve it. Sunday I make a new Java tutorial about the static imports my second tutorial in the year I progress little, but I start to try to help others developers.

##### Day 1164 Start in Action

I think that today I start to growth my career in another level. Well the first time that I try to share my knowledge is not the better but is the start. The most difficult part to try new things is only to start to do it. Yeah, definitively the next year I start my own tech blog. My next goal is this writes tech articles and tutorials, and learn more English.

##### Day 1163 Nervous

Tomorrow I have my first skill share session, this is the first time that I do this. The first time that try to share my knowledge with another persons in a meeting, and is in English more difficult for me, but I think that is the moment to start growth my career.

##### Day 1162 Continue with my RedHat Course

Today I continue advance in my RedHat course about Container Platform Application Deployment, this course is hard to do, but the labs are amazing.

##### Day 1161 Java Logging System

In one application, I need to create a log system using the own Java library, this library is good, but have some lacks. I start to think and design a good solution for this problem. I imagine a simple but powerful solution. Well, I am excited about this.

##### Day 1159-1160 Kubernetes Services

Today I learn how works the Kubernetes services, it is amazing how the Kubernetes architecture is structured to not create coupled between applications. I am learning a lot about this, and obviously I can apply all of this knowledge in my next coding.

##### Day 1158 Reading and Red Hat Certification

Today I continue reading my current book, and advance in my Red Hat certification. Also I need to refresh my mind about Polymorphism tomorrow I need to write a tutorial in which I need to explain what is Polymorphism.

##### Day 1157 Goals

Today I continue reading my book, practice TDD, and I establish some goals related to my Software Engineer career, these goals are related to Java and Microservices.

##### Day 1156 Software Craftsmanship

Today I continue with the reading of my book, and some YouTube videos about TDD, I want to compromise to do this technique of coding in my daily work. Definitely, I think that practice TDD is a good choice.

##### Day 1155 Mockito Library

Today I study Mockito library, I try to understand in a good way how to mock dependencies, I try to apply TDD in my day work. Tomorrow I continue to study Java.

##### Day 1154 I Learned New Things About Containers

Today I study about how to build your own Containers, you need to take a basic image and apply the necessary changes to this image with a file called Dockerfile or Container file. I always thought that Docker is the unique way to build containers, but this is not true, you can build containers with many shapes, it is interesting how the community advance in these topics fast. Well, the change is the unique thing that never changes.

##### Day 1153 Study

Today I advance in my Red Hat certification about containers and OpenShift, I review some topics and learn new. I need to start to read a new book, I am bored without read.

##### Day 1151-1152 How Do You Explain a Computer Science Topic?

Today I need to write a tutorial in which I need to explain a Java characteristic. I like to write tutorials because in this part I discover my gaps and lacks. Is complicated, try to teach any topic in which you do not have the necessary acknowledge, and this is a good signal that you need to be better in this topic.
