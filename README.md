# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer.
Maintaining a record of our progress is invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 1525-26 Linux, Linux and more Linux

These days I continue working in my red hat certification, I am learning useful linux commands like look for files using regex patterns, learn how works with OpenShift pods testing connections between pods to troubleshoot common errors.

### Day 1524 Python and Dependency Injection

Today I ask me what is the reason that dependency injection in python is not a common use technique. I am working in writing python code, the problem is that to mock some database dependency, the best option is to mock the database dependency using the dependency injection technique. With Python the most common option used is mock/patch directly the function.

### Day 1523 Linux and OpenShift

Today I continue learning more about Linux and OpenShift. Working in my Red Hat certification, I learned how to deploy an application using the OpenShift web console, creating a project and deploy an application from an image stored in a container registry.

### Day 1520-21-22 Linux

These days I was studying about Linux, I am working in a Red Hat certification to gain more knowledge about Linux I started to read The Linux Command Line book. In my first days I learned some interesting things like the shell is a program to accept keyboard inputs from the user and send these inputs to the operating system, the most common shell programs are **bash** and **zsh**, also I learned that to interact with a shell we require a terminal emulator like iTerm, I am reading the book at the same time doing some code exercises with Java, creating some abstractions to emulate a operating system in code. I am happy writing code.

### Day 1519 Http Go Server

Today I was writing a HTTP server with golang, I want to know how build a HTTP server with Go only for curiosity because I hear a lot of times that golang is a great language, and well create a basic HTTP server is a easy task.
Golang > Python.  

### Day 1517-18 OpenShift

Today doing my Red Hat certification I studied OpenShift platform, I am happy because I can understand an ambiguous topic in software engineer for me what is a Cluster and a Node? Cluster is a group of servers that work together, and a node is a server inside the cluster. The OpenShift platform uses a node as the master node to control some operations in the OpenShift cluster, but if this node fails, the OpenShift platform can use another node as the master.
Overall, understanding the concept of clusters and nodes is fundamental to understanding how OpenShift platform works. I'm excited to continue learning and exploring its capabilities!

### Day 1515-16 Python Pandas

These days I dedicated some time to learn more about Python pandas library. I will want to have some expertise with Python and basic data analytics task like read data, filter data, transform data and so on. Also I love to write useful Python scripts to automate my daily activities, really help me to save a lot of time in manual work.

### Day 1514 Continue with Executor

Today I have been writing a tutorial to understand what is a Java executor and how you can use a Executor in you Java code. Tomorrow I will investigating about how the Executor works the Go language, I want to understand the abstract concept about this.

### Day 1512-13 Java Executor

Today I have been learning about what is and how works an Executor in Java. I planning to create a Java tutorial trying to understand this concept, I want to learn the abstract concept about an Executor and understand how to works with them with Java and maybe Golang.

### Day 1511 Java Optional

Today I created an elegant solution to a Java problem, I will need to call a method to get something, if this X item exists do action A and if doesn't exists do action B, I have the idea to return a Java optional from the calling method an use the ifPresentOrElse method from the Java optional rather than a if statement.
The result code was elegant and beautiful.

### Day 1510 Java JFR

Today I was learning more about the JFR tool due to some performance issues in my work related with high CPU usage for a Java application.

### Day 1509 Visual Studio Code Problems

Today I was reading the Settings Sync Visual Studio Code documentation, I am having some problems with sync my editor configuration. Maybe I will need to continue solving this issue tomorrow.

### Day 1508 Continuing with Reading

Today, I delved further into the "Software Developer Career" book, focusing on its second chapter, which delves into the Mindset for Career and Life. The book provides valuable insights into enhancing one's self-esteem, vital for both personal growth and becoming a better software developer. Reading through it, I experienced several 'aha' moments, gaining new psychological insights that shed light on various topics. The book's exercises aided in understanding my career perspective and contemplating my thoughts.

### Day 1507 Completed Course

Today I completed the Introduction to Containers with Podman course for the Cloud-Native Certified Developer.
In this course I refresh and learn new things about Containers. I learned a interesting thins like manage container lifecycle, manage network and volumes with Podman, also how to create Database Containers. I love how Podman wants to facilitate the container deployment in a local Kubernetes cluster to test applications in local environment.

### Day 1506 OpenShift Container Platform

Today I was studying about the OpenShift platform. I have been doing the Red Hat certification for one month, really  Red Hat things sometimes are hard. But I want to be a Red Hat Certified Cloud Native Developer. OpenShift platform is a great piece of software, I don't know why but I love work with Containers and Kubernetes.

### Day 1505 Implementing SELinux System

Today I worked in a little implementation of the SELinux system with Java code. I wrote a label, object and a folder classes to represent the label and the objects in the SELinux mechanism. Also I created a SELinux component to validate that some user with X label has access to the folder with the X label. Project-Based learning is really a great way to learn software engineering concepts.

### Day 1504 SELinux

Today I did a little study about the SELinux system. The Security-Enhanced Linux is a security architecture system to control the resources access into a linux system, resources like files, processes and folders. SELinux works as a labeled system to give access to the subjects/users.

### Day 1502-03 Scala and Spark

These two days I am learning how to create a uber jar file given a Scala project. Really I waste a lot of time looking tutorials in the internet, finally I found the answer in the sbt-assembly-plugin official documentation. Please first read the documentation before look for an answer in the internet or ChatGPT.
Tomorrow I will need to continue developing my Scala and Spark application.
