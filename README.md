# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think
it is very important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started
programming I wanted to have a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have
taken and this repository is the result of that record.

#### Day 751

Today finish authentication for my personal project, authentication based of username and
