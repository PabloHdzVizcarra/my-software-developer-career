# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

#### Day 1075 Python

Today I made code with Python, I need to learn a lot of things about Python name conventions, projects structure, testing, classes or functions. Python is interesting I think that with the JVM (Java, Kotlin, Scala), Python, Cloud Computing and Microservices, I have a lot of fun for a very long time.

#### Day 1073-1074 Free Days

In my country the Friday was free day of work. These days I am practice scripting with bash and python, tomorrow I like continue scripting but now with Groovy and Kotlin scripting that is a beta feature in the Kotlin language.

#### Day 1072 Sick

Today I was worked with a little cold, but all day I have had a sleep, I think that these days we need to relax and rest, well only do a little coding.

#### Day 1071 Certificates

The topic of the Certificates it's very big, when you start work with a big companies that have a concern for the security, the sessions starts with certificates authentication, and all services have a great security well I think that this topics are important not only for little applications or enterprises.

#### Day 1070 Programmer Day

Elaborate a repeat task when you a programmer it's a lost of time, in the daily work we need to do some task that can be manual and this task take sometimes little or long time, sometimes the ethernet is slowly and maybe you need to open a lot of browser tabs or login in some places  and you need to do all this steps for start to do the task, then if you want to automate this process and you can save time for you and your company and money obviously you need to image how you can automate this little or bigger tasks, sometimes the only thing that you need to do it's start, and the next steps will be come alone, well the next time that you start a manual process think, I can automate this?  

#### Day 1069 Take a Decision

Take a decision in your career it's a hard thing, more if this decision is what will be your specialized area, your
lifetime is limited, and you need to start to study your specialized, imagine that you need learn only one thing in your
career I don't know could be Java , Docker, Python, MYSQL, Mongo, Linux, and another technologies your time its valuable,
and you cannot learn all things in your life , for this reason you need to learn a little for all required technologies
for your work and make deep dive in one thing , and in this one thing you convert in a professional, this is the problem
how you can choose one thing?, well in the So Good They Can't Ignore you book the author says the same advice, well I
need a meditation time this week only work for four days, good time to think this.

##### Day 1067-1068 Study Important Things

Today I have been thinking that if you study something, you need to have a good reason for study this, Today and
Yesterday I was studied about Quarkus and Micronaut Java frameworks and these frameworks are amazing but for the moment
I cannot use in my work and I do not have personal projects too, then these frameworks for the moment is not
necessary for my career of personal life, and I not say that you won't study new things, only that you need to study
some new things and apply this new learn things in some project or idea, well I expect that my advice help you.

##### Day 1066 I Have a Road Map

Well, this weekend I will be making my professional personal Road Map, my manager and my mentor talk me that I need to
think that what branch of the programming world I like to specialize in, a hard decision, but if I think with an Agile
methodology I can change my decision with some springs.

##### Day 1065 Mentors

Today I have my first talk with my mentor, well this situation solve some concerns that I can have about my
career, for the moment I have calm in my mind, and today I can sleep well.

##### Day 1064 I Need to Talk With More Security

I need to learn how talk with more professionalism, with more security, I think that sometimes
I know more than can says, but always I have nervous, I need to let.

##### Day 1063 Meaningless Things

Today I have see some code without form, I don't know how says this code make some strange things,
I think that if you don't expand your knowledge you can finish cutting wood with a soccer ball.

##### Day 1062 Without Power

Today in my house the power failed for a couple of hours and the bad thing is that I was on
working hours sometimes I think I'm a little silly with these things I thought I was not going
to be able to work during the day and I just had to go to a place where there was electricity
sometimes I forget that I already have a laptop.

##### Day 1061 New Book About Soft Skills

Today I start read a new book about Soft Skills, this book start with a great advice,
build your own career, I need a read this, I have a great Job in a Great Company for the moment
I need to focus in how power up my work.

##### Day 1060 A Grit Moment

well today after three weeks I have finish my Python book, really sometimes I back down, but I
remember that the Grit == Success.

##### Day 1058-1059 Events and Microservices

Sometimes I think that the Microservices architectures oriented to Event-Driven are a
challenge, though this is the funny part, if you are decide to study Microservices Architectures
all time you will have fun.

##### Day 1057 Linux Servers

In my first month in my new job, I never think that I will focus in RabbitMQ, but I like
it, I make a deep dive in RabbitMQ use and installation always the event driven architectures
I like.

##### Day 1056 Python Scripting and RabbitMQ

Today I document some configurations and put these configurations in a Python Script, I am
programmer I don't like the manual configurations xD.

##### Day 1055 OOP In Python

The Object-Oriented programming in python is strange, I like python because you can write
a lot of scripts in an easy way, and you can write some microservice very fast a lightweight form.

##### Day 1054 Relax Day

Today I finish a course about threat modeling an interesting topic that I was not know a
little, well It's time to choice another book/course.

##### Day 1053 Python And Test

This day I was practice python with TDD methodology, I know a little about testing in python
well only I don't know a good way the libraries that you would use with python in testing.

##### Day 1052 Threat and Security

Today for the afternoon after my job, I learn a lot about threat security and cyber-security
themes, well I was practice English too with others persons.

##### Day 1051 Learning and Reading

Well this day I read a lot about some topics for the work and a personal book about minimalism.
