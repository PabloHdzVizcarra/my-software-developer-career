# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 1153 Study

Today I advance in my Red Hat certification about containers and OpenShift, I review some topics and learn new. I need to start to read a new book, I am bored without read.

##### Day 1151-1152 How Do You Explain a Computer Science Topic?

Today I need to write a tutorial in which I need to explain a Java characteristic. I like to write tutorials because in this part I discover my gaps and lacks. Is complicated, try to teach any topic in which you do not have the necessary acknowledge, and this is a good signal that you need to be better in this topic.
