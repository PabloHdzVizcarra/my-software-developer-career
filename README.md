# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer. Maintaining a record of our progress is invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 1862: Continue with AWS Practice Exams and Creating a Bash Script

Today, I continued doing practice exam for the AWS certification, in other topics I write a bash script to perform an action every ten minutes in an infinite while loop, the idea was avoid execute the command that triggers another process every time when the process is completed, with this way the script attempts every ten minutes execute the process.

### Day 1861: IBM Cloud Advocate Certification

Today, I continued studying for the IBM Cloud Advocate certification. At the moment, I am focusing on answering quizzes for this certification. I needed to revisit this study because the exam is scheduled for the last days of November or the first days of December.

I feel tiredâ€”why? Because I am working on achieving four certifications simultaneously:

1. IBM Cloud Advocate  
2. AWS Cloud Practitioner  
3. [Airflow Fundamentals](https://academy.astronomer.io/astronomer-certified-apache-airflow-core-exam)  
4. [Airflow DAG Authoring](https://academy.astronomer.io/astronomer-certification-apache-airflow-dag-authoring)  

The last two were not originally planned in my schedule, but I received a coupon to take both for free (with a 30-day expiration). I have organized a schedule to study for these certifications on specific days to avoid burnout and as a study technique. Iâ€™ll share more details in the future if this strategy proves effective. But please avoid work in multiple software certifications ðŸ˜….

### Day 1860: Airflow

Today I continue studying about Airflow, I am working in the next Airflow [course]("https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101").
I obtained the Airflow Fundamentals Exam free with a promotion, so I am studying Airflow to get the **Airflow Fundamentals Certification**.
I will need to pause my other current certifications because this promotion has a 30-days expiration time, so I only have 30 days to study and prepare for the exam.
  
### Day 1859: AWS and Testing Techniques

Today I continue with the AWS practice exams, for the moment I am getting better exam results, the key is to memorize the service definitions to match a use case with a definition.
For the Software Engineering at Google book I continue reading the testing book part, the book have 4 chapters dedicated to testing, looks like Google loves good software tested.

### Day 1858: Creating a new Repository and Continue with PostgreSQL

Today I created a new GitHub repository to store my Dockerfile and docker-compose files. The idea behind this repository is to have all my container files in one place because I have several Dockerfiles in my personal computer and my two Linux servers. I love to work with Docker and set up my own resources like databases, message brokers, etc., in containerized environments. You can find the repository in the next [link]("https://github.com/pablohdzvizcarra/personal-docker-library"). Also, I continued working on configuring my PostgreSQL database. I was working on setting up a separate container to create a backup of my database every day and store the backup in my serverâ€™s disk drive.

### Day 1857: Setting Up PostgreSQL Database and Airflow DAG Development

Today I worked into setting up a PostgreSQL database with Docker. I create a docker compose to deploy a PostgreSQL with special configurations, I was learning about the best ways to deploy and manage this database within a container, with configurations for performance, security and health checks. I created and configure the PostgreSQL database to save some data from my Airflow DAG into the database.

### Day 1856: Airflow DAG and Continue With AWS Practice Exams

Today I continue working on my Udemy course about practice exams by the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. Also I was working into my Airflow DAG, for the moment I am configuring the DAG to load the extracted data into a PostgreSQL database.

### Day 1855: Airflow, Google Testing Blog and Beyonce Rule

Today I discovered some amazing things reading the Software Engineering at Google book, I have been reading the chapter of testing at google, looks like testing in google is a mature process and is required that any engineer working on Google work with a test methodology. I discover the Google Testing Blog a good place to find useful information about testing, also I learned the Beyonce rule for testing `If you liked it, then you shoulda put a test on it`, this rule is amazing xD. In other words I continue with my DAG development in Airflow.

### Day 1854: Working on the Udemy Practice Exams Course

Today, I continued working through the Udemy course and completed practice test number 3. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t pass, scoring 61% (the minimum passing score is 70%). I struggled particularly with questions related to Billing & Pricing and Cloud Concepts. The challenge with AWS is that it has so many services, making it difficult to remember all of them. Since I donâ€™t work with AWS services in my daily activities, itâ€™s harder for me to recall the most common service usages and descriptions. Iâ€™ll need to keep practicing and studying to feel fully prepared for the exam.

### Day 1853: Code Documentation

Today reading the Software Engineer at Google book, I review an important topic in software engineering Documentation. Documentation focusing on software products and code
is one of the most important aspect of good code, when you write good documentation for your API code, is easy for a user understand how your code works and the things that the code do.

### Day 1852 Studying for AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam

Today I continue working in the 6 Practice Exam | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Udemy course. I completed two of the six practice test.
The first was completed with 82% grade and the second with 72% grade. The minimum to pas the exam is 70%, really this exam is a little crazy, AWS have a lot of services to Studying
the idea is study the most important services and have luck like a coding interview in which you know how to solve a good number of problems waiting for find that problems in your coding interview.

### Day 1851 Continue with AWS and Reading

During this day I only studied a brief time for my AWS certification, for the moment I am only focusing on solving example exams to practice for the real, I completed the required courses. I have been reading the Software Engineering at Google book, for the moment in chapter 10. Documentation.
