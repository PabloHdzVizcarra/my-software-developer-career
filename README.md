# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository, I will keep the progress of my career as a software engineer. I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming, I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Changes My Life

#### Day 1376-77 Zip Files and Java

Today I tried to unzip a ZIP with Java only in memory the idea was,
given a ZIP file in bytes,
I need to take these bytes and create a ZIP file in memory and next given thr ZIP file in memory only select one file 
inside the ZIP file a process it.
With Python this activity is fast, but with Java is a little complicated more low level I think,
well I need to continue working on this.

#### Day 1374-75 Continue Reading and Change Home

These days have been quite busy for me. The company I work for is located in a different country, so I need to relocate
and spend two days each week working in the office. Finding a suitable rental house has been a challenge as the rental
companies in this city have strict requirements. It's been a bit overwhelming to juggle everything while also trying to
find time for studying. Moving homes can be quite demanding, but I'm determined to make it work.

#### Day 1373 Gradle Dependencies

Today I learned a new concept **data lineage**.
I don't think of this concept anytime because what person thinks about where the data comes?.
All of these new things about data engineering are amazing,
I have a lot of desires to write some production code with Spark and Scala,
definitely, spark is my next programming language to learn.

#### Day 1371-72 Continue Learning Spark

I have been reading the Spark in action book these days, I am reading the last part of the book.
Today and tomorrow I will be learning about performance techniques to improve the performance in Java.

#### Day 1369-70 Spark and New Home

I have been reading the Spark in action book on the weekend, also I am ordered my things in my month temporal home.

#### Day 1366-67-68 Go to the Office

I am having a busy weekend,
I need to change my home because on the next week I need to start to go to the office,
the remote work is over, now I need to work in a hybrid environment.

#### Day 1365 Spark User Defined Functions (UDF)

Today I begin to study about how to create User Defined Functions in Spark,
UDF is a great tool to extend the Spark static functions and create your own functions to apply any type of logic.
Creating an UDF is a hard task to understand, really hard,
but I believe that with practice I can gain more knowledge with this spark feature.

#### Day 1364 Energy Problems

Today I had some problems with the electric energy in my house.
Due to these problems, I feel stressed because I cannot advance in my work and well the stress attacks me.
I continue reading the Spark book, today I have studied how to transform some data in JSON and CSV files.

#### Day 1361-62-63 SQL in Spark

On the weekend I continue reading the Spark in Action book,
I studied the different types of joins that Spark has like _inner_, _Left_, _Right_, etc.
Also, I did some exercises using more SQL in Spark filtering and grouping data.

#### Day 1360 Working with Spark Functions

Today I was learning about the split function in spark,
also I learned how to use the expr like SQL, with the expr you can compute mathematical operations with the data.
On the weekend, if I have some free time, I need to focus on continue reading the Spark book.

#### Day 1359 Concurrency and Parallelism

Today I have been studying about concurrency and parallelism in Computer Science more focus on Java.
I did some exercises applying these two types of techniques using the Java concurrency libraries.
Really, these topics can be hard to understand, but it's the next level in my software career like design patterns.

#### Day 1358 Five Steps in Data Transformation

Today I started to learn about the five steps in data transformation,
data discovery, data mapping, application engineering, application execute and data review.
I know that every data pipeline has your own steps or processes,
but I do not know that the industry handles your own standards for the data transformation process.
I don't know why working with data, massive data is a pleasure for me.

#### Day 1357 Continues with SQL in Spark

Today I have been continuing doing more exercises about how to use SQL with Spark,
also I remember a gold rule when I did my exercises _a dataframe in Spark is immutable_.

#### Day 1356 SQL queries in Spark

Today I learned how to create SQL queries in Spark, how to create views to use for the target of the queries.
It's amazing how Spark offers support for SQL,
I do not be a fan or SQL,
the most of the time I prefer NoSQL databases in my personal projects, especially MongoDB and IBM Cloudant.
Really, I learned a lot of Spark and Java with this book.
I love the JVM languages.

#### Day 1354-55 Processing Parallel Data

On the weekend I have been studying about how to manipulate data in a parallel process;
parallelism is an advance topic in software engineering,
one of these things that you need to learn when you work in a distributed system and performance applications.

#### Day 1353 Ingesting Data to Spark by Stream

Today I practice how to ingest data to Spark using a stream the idea was use the previous built application that
generates text files in some directory with fake data,
next I need to create a Spark that application that reads these files continuously as a dataframe.

#### Day 1352 Record Generator Application

Today I start to do a record generator app the idea is creating an application that creates some fake data,
next to this data creates a files (CSV, JSON) with the records simulating stream generator data.

#### Day 1351 Testing Spark Data Source

Today I continue building the data source implementation following the tutorial,
the tutorial does not have any unit testing, and I start to create some unit testing to understand the code in a better
way, the code is a very complex due to the complexity of the implementation, and well, I do not have high knowledge with
Spark.
