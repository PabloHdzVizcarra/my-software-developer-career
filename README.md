# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer.
Maintaining a record of our progress is invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 1721-22 Go Project and DSA

Today I continued working on my Go distributed file system project, also I continue studying the Programming Skills LeetCode study plan. I started to solve the LeetCode problems with Go.

### Day 1719-20 Starting a Go Project

Watching some videos on YouTube and investigating more about how to create my own implementation of a Message Broker with Java, I discovered a good YouTube channel with a very good golang tutorial, the channel is [Channel]("https://www.youtube.com/@anthonygg_"), I am following the tutorial to learn how to create a distributed file storage with Go. This tutorial is very extensive and is my first tutorial to create a low level application with Golang, most of my technical background comes from creating web applications with Java/Python/TypeScript. Also I started to practice on LeetCode solving the problems with Go.

### Day 1717-18 Message Brokers

During the weekend I have been studied the Message Brokers theory. I begin with a medium Go tutorial [Article]("https://medium.com/@parvjn616/building-a-message-broker-in-go-a-beginners-guide-e4d8be2359c"), on this tutorial I build a in memory basic implementation, after completing the tutorial I started my own implementation using Java. I used the Socket Java API to create the Socket server, a client can connect to the server, I used the **nc** linux tool to create the client. When the client connects to the Java server can send messages and the server needs to know how to understand the message. Really interesting how a message broker works under the hood. I have the plan to work on this learning project for some months. My idea is to become a expert on message brokers. I had bast experience working with Kafka and RabbitMQ.

### Day 1716 Log42j Problems

Today I was debugging a problem with the Log42j Java library, for the project the library uses a configuration XML file to configure the logging properties, the problem was I don't know why the application was not showing info logs, I reviewed the library documentation and looks like fine. At the end of the day I replace all the info log statements to error, with this change the applications works with normal behavior. I don't want to learn about this library I prefer use the SE logging library.

### Day 1715 Sorting Problems

Today I started to solve sorting problems, I discovered that I had problems understanding problems with a lot of words, problems that are tricky to understand and you will need first understand the problem, second discover the pattern and third solve the itself problem. Sorting problems for my are good candidates to practice this because most of the sorting problems contains a strange explanation.

### Day 1714 Medium Problems on LeetCode

Today I attempted to solve two medium LeetCode problems, after a few attempts and spend more than 40 minutes in each problem I couldn't solve them. I needed to view the solutions to understand how solve them and also understand the pattern problems. 

### Day 1713 Solving Recursion and Medium LeetCode Problems

Today I solved two medium problems on LeetCode related to arrays and math, also I reviewed the recursion topic again, working with trees I discovered that my recursion knowledge needs to be refreshed and I have a lack of knowledge about this topic.

### Day 1710-11-12 Binary Search Tree

These days I have been studying about binary search trees, I learned how to implement a BST with Python and the basic operation like inserting, deleting, update and searching for elements. I learned about pre-order and post-order traversals ways to traverse a BST.

### Day 1708-09 Bitmasking

Today I learned the concept of bitmasking, bitmasking is the concept of represent something in their binary form, I solved a leet code problem in which I represent an string into a bitmask represent the existence of a character with a number 1 in the bitmask, with this representation was easy found duplicates characters in the string.

### Day 1707 Time Limit Exceeded on Algorithms

Today I have been working on a problem, I solved the problem with a brute force solution, the problem was with the brute force the algorithm exceeded the time limit. So, I will need to investigate how can I improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

### Day 1706 Quick Select and Quick Sort Algorithms

Today I studied these two sorting and selection algorithms. Quick sort is one of the most efficient algorithms to sort array elements in the average case, quick sort has a Big O notation of `O(N log N)`. For the moment I don't understand how works the quick select algorithm, looks like magic how it's works.
