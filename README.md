# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 1064 I Need to Talk With More Security

I need to learn how talk with more professionalism, with more security, I think that sometimes 
I know more than can says, but always I have nervous, I need to let.

##### Day 1063 Meaningless Things

Today I have see some code without form, I don't know how says this code make some strange things, 
I think that if you don't expand your knowledge  you can finish cutting wood with a soccer ball.

##### Day 1062 Without Power

Today in my house the power failed for a couple of hours and the bad thing is that I was on 
working hours sometimes I think I'm a little silly with these things I thought I was not going 
to be able to work during the day and I just had to go to a place where there was electricity 
sometimes I forget that I already have a laptop.

##### Day 1061 New Book About Soft Skills

Today I start read a new book about Soft Skills, this book start with a great advice, 
build your own career, I need a read this, I have a great Job in a Great Company for the moment
I need to focus in how power up my work.

##### Day 1060 A Grit Moment

well today after three weeks I have finish my Python book, really sometimes I back down but I 
remember that the Grit == Success.

##### Day 1058-1059 Events and Microservices

Sometimes I think that the Microservices architectures oriented to Event-Driven are a 
challenge, though this is the funny part, if you are decide  to study Microservices Architectures 
all time you will have fun.

##### Day 1057 Linux Servers

In my first month in my new job, I never think that I will focused in RabbitMQ but I like 
it, I make a deep dive in RabbitMQ use and installation always the event driven architectures 
I like.

##### Day 1056 Python Scripting and RabbitMQ

Today I document some configurations and put this configurations in a Python Script, I am
programmer I don't like the manual configurations xD.

##### Day 1055 OOP In Python

The Object-Oriented programming in python is strange, I like python because you can write
a lot scripts in an easy way, and you can write some microservice very fast an a lightweight form.

##### Day 1054 Relax Day

Today I finish a course about threat modeling an interesting topic that I was not know a 
little, well It's time to choice another book/course. 

##### Day 1053 Python And Test

This day I was practice python with TDD methodology, I know a little about testing in python
well only I don't know a good way the libraries that you would use with python in testing.

##### Day 1052 Threat and Security

Today for the afternoon after my job, I learn a lot about threat security and cybersecurity 
themes, well I was practice English too with others persons.
