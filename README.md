# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 1051 Learning and Reading

Well this day I read a lot about some topics for the work and a personal book about minimalism.

##### Day 1050 Bad Moments

Today I has a bad moment, my English is not good and I had a meet with some people that only 
speak English, a bad situation for my part, I was only can understand some words and phrases 
that they was speak, well I need to start speak and study more English now, this is my new goal.  

##### Day 1049 English

Well, we have been informed that we will start working with people who speak English as a
language, so it is time to start practicing more English.

##### Day 1048 Security

Security in the applications in my last work it's not apply in any part of the system, but I need 
to learn about this topics because I need to start to think in how we design and maintenance 
secure applications.

##### Day 1047 - 1048 Event Messages

Today I finish that read the RabbitMQ Essentials book, this books its a high level review of this 
tool, I know Apache Kafka but RabbitMQ is some different to Apache Kafka but some concepts are 
similar any way at all I love Microservices.

##### Day 1046 Read Carefully

Well of the problems I had during the week I was able to solve 2 of them, it's funny how if you
pay more attention to what you read maybe you will save a lot of time, I will be able to dedicate 
my weekend to continue with my learning.

##### Day 1045 Divide and Conquer

I think I was forgetting this technique, it is curious to see how one can lose one's head in the 
face of difficult problems.

##### Day 1044 Hard Things

how often do we not have a task that seemed easy, but in the end ends up being difficult I love the 
uncertainty in software development.

##### Day 1043 A Lot of Info

Today I burn my brain with a lot info about RabbitMQ, I had time that this did not happen to me.

##### Day 1042 RedHat Servers

Well I have my first task in my new work it's some interesting I need to learn about some new topics.

##### Day 1041 Reading About Python

Well this weekend I continue with my book about python, I want to finish this book and start to learn more
about how automatize process with python and Docker, and start to learn IBM cloud too.

##### Day 1040 Python Scripting

I want to do a deep dive in python scripting, in my work we make a lot of manual process than I think with a 
little of knowledge of scripting, we can save a lot of time and make a less more that this manual process.  

##### Day 1038, 1039 Deep Learning Day

In my work today was a Deep Learning Day this day was great I learn a lot of things IA, Cloud Computing, Quantum 
Computers, Agile, etc. This thinks of my work I love it.

##### Day 1037 Events

Well today I learn about RabbitMQ, this message broker have some similar characteristics with Kafka but in some ways
is different, I practice with RabbitMQ, Python and Kotlin. Tomorrow I need to finish my learn project.

##### Day 1036 Python, SFTP, and read work docs

This day I was playing with python and the SFTP protocol, I created two SFTP server with Docker, and pass files
between this servers, in my work we use a lot SFTP protocol, and I need to do deep dive in this topic.

##### Day 1035 Python Book

Well I decide to I need to learn python with a good way, I start to read the book Head First Python, and my firsts
impressions of this book are great. 

##### Day 1034 SFTP and C4 Architecture

Today I have reviewed these two concepts, it seems that I still need to review the software architectures part, I know
what will be my next book when I finish reading about microservices.

##### Day 1033 Python

Today I was practice python, in the work some services are write in python, and I don't know this language, I am ready
now for my first problems with python.

##### Day 1032 Without Electric Energy

After five o'clock, the electric energy in my city is off, without internet the time pass more slowly, but I can use
the time to think about me and what things I do fine, and the things that can do wrong, the next week I start to do code
in my new work I am excited.

##### Day 1031 One:One

Today I had my first one by one with my manager, well I am new in my work the expectation for me still little for the
moment I think.

##### Day 1030 Tutorials, tutorials and more tutorials

Well all the people I know who work en software companies of great importance have told me about the onboard-ing
tutorials they receive, I think it is also important to learn about the culture of the company, and it is always good
to refresh some knowledge that you thought you had learned very well.

##### Day 1029 Coding With Laptop?

Currently, I have only a laptop for coding, my extra monitor don't work with the laptop bad news, but I am happy with
the laptop for my work. It's great, and it has more hardware for my personal computer.

##### Day 1027-1028 New Job

Today is the day, today I started my new job as a software developer, I will do my best to do a great job and although
at the beginning it will be difficult I know I can do it, I will do it again, programming has changed my life.

##### Day 1026 Learning Design

When I continue read my book about microservices, but I start learning event driven architecture in this part of the
book I take a break in this part to make deep dive in this point I think that this is very important topic in
programming and system design in general.

##### Day 1025 Good Day

Today I was a bad experience in my work well maybe I should say in my old work, today I quit my work the Monday I
start work in another company, I am excited guys never back down, each book, each YouTube tutorial, each paper, each
course that you read brings them one step closer to their goal.

##### Day 1024 External APIs

Today I was working with some external APIs, when they don't have a good documentation with examples this is a
problem, well also I don't understand how someone who is going to commercialize some API does not create a good doc.

##### Day 1023 Kubernetes Issues

Today I had a problem with Kubernetes of those problems that when you have the logs do not help at all, well in the end
I could solve it, but I left an important lesson document things well for next time.

##### Day 1022 Infrastructure as a Code

This concept is still not very clear to me in my morning reading of my book on microservices I studied it a little,
but I didi not manage to clarify it I think I will have to investigate a little more on my own.

##### Day 1021 Headache and Code

Well the tittle says all, try to make code with a big headache it's not good, but the job is the job, and the code
it's all.

##### Day 1020 Grit Test

Today I took my Grit test again, this test is designed to know how much Grit you have and how hard you are willing
to work for your goals, my score was lower than last month, but because this time I was more honest.

##### Day 1019 Kotlin and JavaFX

It's been a long time since I had fun like today, today I was playing with Kotlin and JavaFX at work we don't have
internal tools to test some technologies, and I started to create two simple tools for this purpose.

##### Day 1018 Sagas and Transaction

Well in this day I continue learning about Sagas and Transactions in microservices.

##### Day 1017 Sagas Algorithm

I didn't know that this problem has a name, many times at work we have this problem, a transaction goes wrong from a
sub-transactions flow, and we get this problem, and we don't apply an undo to everything else. Wll I have a suggestion
to make in my work, the use of Sagas.

##### Day 1016 Quorum and Microservices

Well today I finished to read the document with a quorum implementation, and I learn some concepts about
microservices how API Gateways and Service Mesh.

##### Day 1015 Quorum

Today I was learning about the Quorum, this is the minimum number of votes that a distributed transaction can be
considered true, I do a basic implementation with Java, and I was reading the PDF document that wrote Dale Skee
about this topic in 1982, tomorrow I learn more about this.

##### Day 1014 Rate API Limits

I have problems with an external API, I need to call this API very fast but your limits don't permit this, I think in
two possible solutions apply delay or make the HTTP request more slow.

##### Day 1013 Modern Technologies and Old Tools

This day I have problems with Kotlin and Maven, Kotlin is a great programming language, but sometimes I be crazy with
basic configurations for make that the project is run, with Gradle sometimes is the same way, for this reason I like
frameworks how Spring that have all things ready to work.

##### Day 1012 Read and read

Today I was read a lot of the book Building Microservices, this book is a great tool to understand you how to can
create a good microservices.

##### Day 1011 You need an organization task tool

Yes I think that all programmers need an organization task tool for your personal learning, sometimes when I read a
book an interesting concept appear, and you want to learn more about this concept, and if you have a tool when you
have a record of your progress can be help you to see your old progress and says I learn a lot of things in this
point.

##### Day 1010 Microservice Communication

The communication in microservices is one of the most important things that you decide when you build a microservice,
async or sync the most common types of communication, well At this moment I have a problem with an async messages
flow, I feel that my head its crazy, I think that this is one of the most difficult parts in programming,
asynchronous I go for you.

##### Day 1009 Oh My Back and Happy Birthday

I remember this scene of the movie Spider-Man, and it's funny At this moment, only to say that I have a big pain in my
back.

##### Day 1008 Estimations

Today I make another estimation for a new feature in the platform, I think that my estimations times its be better with
the time, and I hope finish this feature in the time estimated.

##### Day 1007 WebHooks and Microservices

Today I learned some interesting things about microservices, how to separate responsibilities for
them and how to think better when creating microservices.

##### Day 1006 Scala and JVM

This weekend I was study Scala programming language, how Scala is a language part of the JVM I am
interesting learn for funny reasons, well functional programming is strange with Scala.

##### Day 1005 A Lot of Events

I do an infinite for loop in Kafka today, this is not my intention, but I learn some interesting
things about how Kafka handle the messages in topics and group ids.

##### Day 1004 Wake Up Early

In the calm when it's morning all city is in state of peace, and I can do code with a great
pleasure,
I enjoy these moments.

##### Day 1003 When Things Work Out

Sometimes some things work a good, but another work bad, maybe you think that your solution it's
good, but in the testing its bad in this point you think that you are a bad programmer, wait a
moment and relax, your travel is begun start just now, only enjoy the travel.

##### Day 1002 Asynchronous Thinking

I think that little by little I am understanding asynchronous, I think I just need more practice
and knowledge.

##### Day 1001 Kafka and Kubernetes

This of Kafka and Kubernetes is a big problem, how you make that all events are handle and
controlled this is a challenge, I have few days for finish this feature.
