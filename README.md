# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository, I will keep the progress of my career as a software engineer. I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming, I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Changes My Life


##### Day 1287-88 CI/CD

These two days I am working on a CI/CD implementation,
I remember the time when I was learning about CI/CD with GitHub actions.
In the OpenShift course which I did last year,
I do a little implementation with Jenkins,
looks like on the weekend I need to continuously practice CI/CD. Maybe I need
to do a basic implementation with IBM Continuous Delivery service and GitHub.    

##### Day 1284-85-86 English and New Book

The weekend I continue to study English,
I need to improve my English because I can have basic conversations,
but to work with teams that their primary language is English is difficult for me.
My next book needs to be written in English, and I need to learn without any translating tool.
Maybe Microservice Patterns or some books about software Architecture.

##### Day 1283 Java Date

Today I am studying the ```java.time``` API.I learned how to create instances using these objects and how to parse objects
from the old Date API. I did the exercises using the TDD style, and I have decided to apply TDD to all my future code.
The only exception is for scripts that I write in Python/Groovy where I do not write tests.

##### Day 1282 Ensures Things

Today I have a bad moment, because I do a supposition about something.
In computer science is a good idea to ensure that all the things work fine,
really when you need to answer a question, please do not say I believe,
first review and test the things next, when you ensure that the things work is a good moment to say yes.

##### Day 1281 Celebration Day

Today I complete my hard pending project in my work, I was working on this project for seven months, involves people
from five different teams.
I learn a lot of working on this project and improve my English skill.
Also, I continue my course about communication, collaboration skills,
I am agreed with my mentor that I need to improve these skills because it is the foundations of my career.

##### Day 1280 Load Balancer

Today I need to investigate a little how it works the load balancer,
I review Nginx and Traefik LB,
we have a problem related to one load balancer, and we do not know much information about how it can be configured and
how it works.

##### Day 1279 IBM event Streams

Today I need to do a discovery about the IBM Event Streams service, this service works with Kafka, and I need to use
Kafka to continue with the event sourcing microservice project.

##### Day 1278 Event Sourcing

I continue learning the even sourcing pattern, I start a Java application to apply this pattern in some basic service.
I feel unsure about finishing the project because when I finish this project, the project will never see a production
state.

##### Day 1277 Groovy or Python

Today I need to start a process to ingest a database with some data.
I am learning about IBM Cloud and Microservice I want to practice the Event-Sourcing Pattern with Java and SpringBoot,
but I have some problems with creating the scripts to fill the database, the idea is to take the data from a CSV and
next fill the database with this data, well tomorrow I continue this process but using Python.

##### Day 1275-76 Microservices

I need to focus on learning two things at the moment: English and Microservices.
Improving my English is crucial because it is the foundation of all my knowledge.
Additionally, Java (JVM) and Microservices are my passions.

##### Day 1274 Creating Corrupt Files

Today I tried how to create some corrupts files, I do this task because I am writing a code to validate if the file
works fine, but I cannot achieve this I am writing the code with Python and I need to handle all these steps with bytes,
I don't want to create the file in a tempdir to avoid I/O write operations, also I continue reviewing my next book to
read, currently I am reading why we sleep book, but I need to read at the same time a programming book, maybe the
fundamentals of data engineering or some book about Java.

##### Day 1273 Finish Security Engineering Book

Finally, today I finish reading the Security Engineering book, the largest book that I read 1232 pages.
I learn a lot from reading this book now I cover some lacks in my knowledge about security.
The code that I write after this reading had more security mechanisms.
This book improves my career a lot.

##### Day 1272 Command Design Pattern

Today I practice the Command design pattern in Python with unit testing, I do a basic application in which apply the
command pattern. I need to practice a lot OOP with Python, Python is a great language but, for build big applications
you need to apply OOP principles to do quality code, I think, building a basic script is not the same that build a
Microservice.

##### Day 1270-71 Continue Reading

On the weekend, I continue reading the security engineering book, I am in the last part of the book.
It is amazing all the knowledge acquired; well, I see a lot of things differently with this reading.
Really write security is important how to
apply the correct design itself.

##### Day 1269 DI In Python

Today I refactor some python code to use DI (Dependency Injection), because I have a lot of problems with testing the
code, python how an interpreted language can mock anything in the code with some trick. DI makes the code easier to
test.

##### Day 1268 Stressed

Today I have some stress in my day.
I do not know how to execute a python task in another thread like Java, I need to
discover this step, also how to do TDD with Python in a good way.
I was stressed a lot of learning unit testing with
Python.

##### Day 1267 Software Development Flow

Today I continue to design my best software development flow.
When I start any type of project, I need to apply to
TDD in all the software development process, also I recommend that you create the documentation at the same time and any
type of diagram that you want to add to the project.
Please improve the GitHub Readme, create good commits, and create
documentation about the process.

##### Day 1266 Forgetting Logs

When you write any code, method, class or process, please do not forget to add some logs.
The importance of add logs in any application is great,
because all the time you need to know what do you the application, and well, when you have debug
production problems, you will suffer a lot when trying to discover where is the issue.
Trust me to stop and add logs in the
key parts of the application, important logs.

##### Day 1263,64,65 Reading

I continue reading the Security Engineering book, really I need to finish this book, I have a deadline to April 1 to
finish this lecture, I do not have desire to continue reading this book, but I need to finish.
When I finish this book, my
next goal is finish my RedHat Developer Certification.

##### Day 1262 Java 20

Today I review the new features in Java 20,
I have a lot of problems with trying to execute the code in IntelliJ, I need to
do some configuration steps before compiling and run the code.
Also, I continue reading the Security Engineering book.

##### Day 1261 Scoped Values

Today I watch the Java First, Java Always YouTube video, well, Java is doing a great job with involve the community
with this type of videos.
I learn about the Scoped Values JEP is interesting how Java continues to evolve, and I think
that Scoped Values is a great tool in concurrency problems I remember my errors with some threads executions and modify
variable values with wrong data.

##### Day 1258-59-60 CQRS

These days I have learned about the CQRS Microservice Pattern and build a basic application following a YouTube
tutorial.
I found my focus again I stop learning Scala for the moment and continue to improve my Java skill, 2023 is the
year in which I need to obtain my Java Developer Certification by Oracle, and I need to continue to practice Java.

##### Day 1256-1257 Mac

Today I start with the macOS ecosystem, I buy a MacBook Air my first impressions are great, because I can start to
install all my Java ecosystem with the terminal using SDK man I spend my time today customize my laptop, and write some
basic Java code.
The M1 apple chip looks like fine, IntelliJ run fast, I hope that this laptop has a great performance
and uses in my future learning.

##### Day 1255 Grit

I continue reading my security book, but I need to say that I hate this book now, it is very large, very, very large, I
don't want to continue to read anymore, but I know that all this knowledge acquired with this book is a good thing
for my software developer career at this point the Grit is coming.
I have two options to finish my book or leave it.
Well, I decide this tomorrow.

##### Day 1254 SSH

Today I read the documentation about SHH, and I need to remember how the certificates work, also I notice that I am
putting less attention on my work, this is bad because I need to upgrade my skills rather than downgrade them.
I need to focus on my details and remember why is the reason that I am a programmer.
