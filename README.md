# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository, I will keep the progress of my career as a software engineer. I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming, I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Changes My Life

#### Day 1316 One-way Notifications

Today I have been learning the one-way notification message pattern, this message pattern it's easy to understand, 
but I have some problems trying to implement in a basic program with Kotlin, I don't have good knowledge in Kotlin 
and I don't know how it works the kotlin-test library for write unit testing, tomorrow I will continue implementing 
this pattern and fix my issues with the kotlin-test library 

#### Day 1315 Message Patterns

Today I have been working on learning message patterns in Microservices. I am familiar with Kafka, RabbitMQ, and the
concept of event architecture. It is interesting how simplifying things can help you grasp concepts more quickly. I
completed a small implementation where I applied a message pattern using Java/Python code. Tomorrow I will continue
studying this topic.

#### Day 1312-13-14 Self-improvement

On the weekend, I took a course on self-improvement focused on career management. Additionally, I started reading a book
on the same topic. I sometimes feel lost and need to recover from setbacks. Today, I am continuing to study English and
practice Python and data manipulation.

#### Day 1311 Work Management and Stack Overflow Survey

Today I participated in the Stack Overflow survey for 2023. This is the third year in a row that I have taken part in
this survey, and once it was completed, I eagerly read through the results. It's truly fascinating to see the responses
and insights shared by others.
In the afternoon, I dedicated my time to a course on work management available on the Harvard Manage Mentor platform.
Over the weekend, my plan is to practice and apply the knowledge gained from the course by completing exercises that can
be applied to my daily life.

#### Day 1310 Implementing Service Discovery Patterns

Today I dedicated my time to further enhance my understanding and proficiency in the 3rd party registration and
server-side discovery patterns. Through the implementation process, I followed the principles of Test-Driven
Development (TDD), which yielded satisfying outcomes. Notably, my testing skills have significantly improved, empowering
me to articulate pattern concepts more effectively by practicing with practical examples rather than solely relying on
theoretical descriptions.

Furthermore, I have a mentoring session scheduled for the morning.
While I feel slightly apprehensive about my English proficiency, I am determined to improve my language skills to
communicate more efficiently with English speakers.

#### Day 1308-09 Service Discovery

These days, I have been learning about Service Discovery. I have learned about various patterns such as
Self-Registration, Client-Side Discovery, 3rd-Party Registration, and Server-Side Discovery. Additionally, I have been
practicing implementing these patterns using Java code and applying Test-Driven Development (TDD). However, I feel the
need to dedicate more time to these patterns and engage in additional exercises, as I believe they are of great
importance and can serve as valuable tools in my repertoire.

#### Day 1307 Kubernetes

Throughout the whole day, I have been practicing Kubernetes. I have created several applications and configured a local
Kubernetes cluster to run them. My tasks have involved creating service resources to expose the applications and
ConfigMaps to add environment variables. For most of these tasks, I have relied on ChatGPT, which has proven to be a
valuable tool. However, one challenge I have encountered is understanding the underlying reasons behind the actions.
While I know how to perform certain tasks, grasping the "why" behind them can be more difficult. I believe that studying
books and reading official technology documentation would provide a better understanding of the underlying concepts.

#### Day 1304, 05, 06 ChatGPT and Python

On the weekend, I completed a course on using the ChatGPT API with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
The course was offered by deeplearning.ai, a reputable platform.
I gained valuable insights on creating effective prompts and utilizing various features of ChatGPT.
Additionally, I made progress in reading the "Microservice Patterns" book.

#### Day 1303 Learning Pandas

Today I am continuing learning more about pandas, I need to do a basic diagram showing some data using the matplotlib
python library also I learn how to select some date from a pandas dataframe.
I cannot advance in the Microservice Patterns book because I am continuing studying english.

#### Day 1302 Pandas and PySpark

Well, today I continue practicing with pandas and pyspark python libraries.
I need to analyze some CSV files and extract selected data.
Filter data with pyspark is like SQL, but with pandas I believe that is more efficient.
I do the same process with the two libraries, but with pyspark the process takes more time rather than pandas.
Also, saving a dataframe in a new csv is easier with pandas.

#### Day 1301 Pyspark

Today I learned how to read a CSV file using Pyspark and how to filter the rows in the CSV file with a condition.
Tomorrow I will need to investigate what are the differences between Apache Spark and Pyspark.
I can see that if I turn off my Spark Docker container on my local machine, Pyspark continues working without problems,
and this behavior is strange because what Spark process uses the pyspark library.
I do not know the answer to this question, but tomorrow I will review this.
