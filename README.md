# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life

##### Day 913 A Little Confused

At this moment I am was confused, I don't know how growth my knowledge and my personal career in 
software engineering, I am currently reading a book of Design Patterns, but I don't know maybe need 
learn another thing.

##### Day 912 Working Seriously

I have a lot of task to do in the work, well I think that the time that me spend learning design 
patterns it's time to apply in my current work, I need write better code.

##### Day 911 Factory Pattern

Today was very confusing in my work to understand difficult things is difficult, but also the
pressure to finish things fast in these moments I wonder if programming is for me, well I hope this
will improve with the years.

##### Day 910 Builder Pattern

Today I was studying the builder pattern, in my work I achieve to advance in my tasks and can be
relaxing today.

##### Day 909 Free Day

After having some difficult days and a lot fo work I have relaxed a little this day I have coded a
little, but the desire to code has continued with me all day, guys after spending twenty hours
coding take a break.

##### Day 904 Having A Hard Time

I have had a couple of bad days at work, I seem to take a long time to solve the problems, I don't
like at all to fix one thing but another one has an error, I need to take it easy and see all
possible options.

##### Day 903 The Phrase If It Works Don't Touch It

lately we have had many problems at work with functionalities that work and after some changes they
no longer work correctly.
