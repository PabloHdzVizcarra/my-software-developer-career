# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository I will keep the progress fo my career as a software engineer, I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Change My Life


##### Day 1144 OpenShift Architecture

Today I study how OpenShift is built, what are the main components and what are your main functionalities. I learn a new concept in the Kubernetes world, Operators is a great effort  to create Kubernetes resources in a more easy way.

##### Day 1143 OpenShift

Today I start to learn about Cloud Native Development and OpenShift, in my work we are using OpenShift, I know Kubernetes but OpenShift is new for me and the concept of Cloud Native Development is a little strange for me, but I see that the industry is moving for this way. Well I love Microservices and I think that all of this topics live around Microservices.

##### Day 1142 Java Serialization

I finish reading the Effective Java book, this is a great achieve for me because sometimes I will feel boring reading this book, I think that was result for my knowledge for Java is little. I was to feel sometimes lost reading the book, but well I finish this book. Furthermore, I study about Java serialization because this topic is new for me.

##### Day 1141 Be More Clear

Today I have a problem with a request that I do, the other person understands bad my request because I share little information about your resources. I suppose that the other person know your resources in a good way, and I skip some information for this reason. The next time that I need to share information for a request or something else, I share all the information that I have and try to express in a simple way.

##### Day 1140 Fighting with Docker

Today I fight with Docker for some time, I am not sure how dockerize python applications and I need to do run a python application in docker container. In the end of the day, I can do the application run in Docker container, tomorrow this application needs some changes in source code to work in Docker. The next time, I need to start to create the application thinking to run inside a docker container.

##### Day 1138-1139 Mexican Holiday

Today was holiday in Mexico, well this weekend I can say that I have free time of coding, only read code and write a little code. I advance in my current book and I can start some activities in my house. Tomorrow, I am ready to start my short work week with new ideas and a lot of energy.

##### Day 1137 Continue Reading

Well, today I continue reading my current programming book and finish to read the Think Again book. This last book is awesome, I think that is a lot of useful in your software engineer career. Programmers need to rethink a lot of concepts, techniques, and design decisions in the code and in the ways that we solve the problems.

##### Day 1136 Learning Day

I advance a lot in the Effective Java book, sometimes the tips that this book provides are amazing. I remember the phrase that says you need always have a mind ready to learn, in any place in this career you can learn new things. Furthermore, I try to change my mind when I need some help to solve a problem only read the part of the resolution but not take time to learn the root cause of the problem.

##### Day 1135 Production Issue

Today in the work we have a production issue, this moment was a great moment, because I can work with all of my team members to solve the issue, and I learn that my current team is a great team.

##### Day 1134 Practice English

Today I need to work with a team member that speak only in English, well my first thought is I have fear my English is not good, and I need more practice, later I think that this is good. I think that always I will think that my English is bad, I require only need to lose the fear to speak in English, and more practice a lot of practice.

##### Day 1133 Achievements

Today I have my first achieve in my work, I can finish the first step in my three months project. I learn a lot of things in this journey, and yet I need to do more work to finish this, but today I have my first achieve.

##### Day 1132 A Stress Moment

Today I have a big stress moment in my life, it is amazing how this stress moments can affect your work, and see the little things how bigger problems. Well definitely in my next weekend I need to have an absolute rest about coding.

##### Day 1130 & 1131 My First Answer

Today I finally write my first tutorial, in this tutorial I explain what Stack and Heap in Java is, and how these works in the JVM, well for my this is a great achieve. Always I want to write some type of tutorial, but never choose a topic or I feel the imposter syndrome. Only you need to lose the fear.

##### Day 1129 Learning & Practice Java

Today I am reading and practicing a lot of Java in the Effective Java book. Well the Enum part is amazing,
the Enums in Java have a lot of uses, and the way that you can use to write code is interesting.

#### Day 1128 Relax Day

Today I finally had a quiet day at work again, I have also continued reading the effective java book that although it sometimes bores me, I committed myself to read it, and I am learning a lot of things about Java that I didn't know or I thought I had already mastered.

#### Day 1127 External Dependencies

A lot of times in your software engineer career or in your job, you have external dependencies. An external dependency is a type of task that you need to do to advance in your project, but you don't have control of this task. You need help for other people to achieve this task, and in these situations you need to approach your free time in advance in another steps in your project. It's frustrating in this situation, but is inevitable, calm your mind and enjoy the wait.

#### Day 1126 Shut up and Think Again

Well, reading the Think Again book, I think that this is a great book for software engineers because, this books attacks your assumptions that maybe you can have about Computer Science. When you acquire some experience in some topic, always you can start to think that you always can have the reason in your solutions to apply in the problems. Always remember the in this profession you need to be a learner forever.

#### Day 1125 Retake the Action

I think that I am a person that need to be motivated to continue learning programming every day, it's complicated to explain but after read the Atomic Habits book, refresh my mind and turn back to the way. Maybe to start with meditation, did help me with this. Well, the road is big, very big, and this profession is beautiful, you need to take the things with calm and enjoy the travel.

#### Day 1124 Reading Programming Books with Pomodore

This Sunday, I achieve some pomodores, reading the Effective Java book, when you study a topic for a long time you start to boring in some moment, and you need to maintain free your mind, and focus in your way. Pomodore helps me with this because, I want to do deep dive in technologies like Java, Microservices, Docker, Kotlin. The problem is not enjoying the technology, is support all boring to learn one thing for a long time, years I say.  Thanks Atomic Habits for change my mind.

#### Day 1123 Write Code 1% Better Every Day

Each day you need to write code 1% better than the last day, well if today I write 20 classes, also I need to write 10 test to follow TDD obvious. There are a lot of things  to learn in Software Engineer about how to write code, how to create good classes, how to apply Design Patterns in the code. Quarkus framework is amazing.

#### Day 1122 Nulls in Constructors

Today I learn the reasons because sometimes programming inheritance in Java it's difficult, it's not only have a good hierarchy of classes or a good classes with relationships “is a”. You need to follow some rules in inheritance, I am not sure if this type of rules apply in the same way in another language's example python. Well this weekend I dedicate some time to study Object-Oriented programming in python and testing,  maybe I do some script to automatize some manual task.

#### Day 1121 Security

Today I have realized that I still have a lot to learn about how to protect information, how to make my code more secure and many other topics in software security. Well when I finish my Java book, my next book will be on these topics.

#### Day 1120 Java Frameworks

Today I start to learn Quarkus Java framework for a recommendation of my mentor, my first impressions are good, Quarkus have something that in spring loss.

#### Day 1119 Java Keystore

Today, I learn how to use the Java Keystore to storage certificates, It's strange how Java store the certificates and private keys in a Keystore and then use this data to create TLS connections with some services.

#### Day 1117-1118 Coding in Java

For my personal learning, I practice Test Driven Development while continue to read the effective Java book, and continue to read a lot of code. I like to be how the chess experimented player that he saw a lot of chess tables in your life, and he knows a lot of movements in the game.

#### Day 1116 OpenShift

Today I learn a little bit about OpenShift platform because, I think that to manage OpenShift using the CLI would be more difficult, but OpenShift is easy to use, and Red Hat offers free training for the platform.

#### Day 1115 Reading Atomic Habits

Today I start with a new book Atomic Habits, this book have a great rating on Amazon and TheGoodReaders, and I see that a lot of people recommended. Also, I take the decision that I need to start learning about OpenShift. I not want to be the DevOps in my team, I am not wanted to be the person that don't understand the important things, how the platform in that I deploy the applications. These things cause confusion for my.

#### Day 1113-1114 Some Stress

These days I had some situations in my work with some stress, I continue reading every day this is the great achievement really, and I continue to study about the best practices in Java and the Object-Oriented programming.

#### Day 1112 Objects Equals

Today I study a lot about objects and how to compare them appropriately, it's interesting that how simple invocation of method .equals can have a lot of bad consequences. Tomorrow I continue with this topic.

#### Day 1111 Be More Agile

Today I discover that I have some lacks in Jira and Agile methodology, I need to be more organized, and create good Jira elements, unorganized programmer is not good programmer.

#### Day 1109-1110 Atomic Habits

I found the webpage from James Clear, the author of the atomic habits book. I say wow when I start to read some concepts, a special part calls me my attention that says about not focus on the result, focus in change your person when you're to do your goals. Well, I have a different focus about be a better programmer. I convert in the person that read the Java documentation also read about Microservices and make code every day.

#### Day 1108 My Next Step to Study

Tomorrow I need to decide what is my next topic to study, what is my next step in my career I have some ideas about, what is the thing that more benefit contribute to my career how software engineer.

#### Day 1107 Double Hit

Today I can finish my cloud computer course, and obtain my certification about this course, and also I can finish the book that currently I am reading Chaos Engineering, this book it's amazing. My next step is create a presentation to give to know my team of this concept, I think that great things can be success if us applying Chaos Engineering in our projects. 

#### Day 1106 Great Rest

Monday I travel to my work. Was travel with duration of 10 hours, I can know all of my team, and I have a great day, my workplace it's amazing I am excited about the next time that I need to go. Tomorrow I return to my normal activities, hard work, it's waiting for me.

#### Day 1103 Reading The 7 Habits of People High Efective Resume

Today I continue with read and learning about Chaos Engineering. I think that to propose to start to apply this in my work for my site will not be easy, but I need that the all people in my team, also to start to think in how apply, and also I read a book resume.

#### Day 1102 Free Saturday

Today I have a free day to code, my brain need a relax moment. Well, I only read a little about coding in the morning and in the night I do some code. The next week will hard in my work, and I am preparing to this.

#### Day 1101 Broken the Grit

Today I have a lot of wish to abandoned my book and my course that I am currently doing for a new course/project/book. I have a lot of wish that start with a project or do some code, because I have a lot of time that I not do code in my work or for curious. Well, I need more confidence in my decisions and finish all things that I started.
