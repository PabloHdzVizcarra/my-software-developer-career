# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer.
Maintaining a record of our progress is invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 1509 Visual Studio Code Problems

Today I was reading the Settings Sync Visual Studio Code documentation, I am having some problems with sync my editor configuration. Maybe I will need to continue solving this issue tomorrow.

### Day 1508 Continuing with Reading

Today, I delved further into the "Software Developer Career" book, focusing on its second chapter, which delves into the Mindset for Career and Life. The book provides valuable insights into enhancing one's self-esteem, vital for both personal growth and becoming a better software developer. Reading through it, I experienced several 'aha' moments, gaining new psychological insights that shed light on various topics. The book's exercises aided in understanding my career perspective and contemplating my thoughts.

### Day 1507 Completed Course

Today I completed the Introduction to Containers with Podman course for the Cloud-Native Certified Developer.
In this course I refresh and learn new things about Containers. I learned a interesting thins like manage container lifecycle, manage network and volumes with Podman, also how to create Database Containers. I love how Podman wants to facilitate the container deployment in a local Kubernetes cluster to test applications in local environment.

### Day 1506 OpenShift Container Platform

Today I was studying about the OpenShift platform. I have been doing the Red Hat certification for one month, really  Red Hat things sometimes are hard. But I want to be a Red Hat Certified Cloud Native Developer. OpenShift platform is a great piece of software, I don't know why but I love work with Containers and Kubernetes.

### Day 1505 Implementing SELinux System

Today I worked in a little implementation of the SELinux system with Java code. I wrote a label, object and a folder classes to represent the label and the objects in the SELinux mechanism. Also I created a SELinux component to validate that some user with X label has access to the folder with the X label. Project-Based learning is really a great way to learn software engineering concepts.

### Day 1504 SELinux

Today I did a little study about the SELinux system. The Security-Enhanced Linux is a security architecture system to control the resources access into a linux system, resources like files, processes and folders. SELinux works as a labeled system to give access to the subjects/users.

### Day 1502-03 Scala and Spark

These two days I am learning how to create a uber jar file given a Scala project. Really I waste a lot of time looking tutorials in the internet, finally I found the answer in the sbt-assembly-plugin official documentation. Please first read the documentation before look for an answer in the internet or ChatGPT.
Tomorrow I will need to continue developing my Scala and Spark application.
