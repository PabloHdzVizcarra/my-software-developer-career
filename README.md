# My Journey to Become a Software Engineer

In this repository, I will keep the progress of my career as a software engineer. I think it is very
important that we all have some record of our progress, when I started programming, I wanted to have
a record to go in the future and see what decisions I have taken and this repository is the result
of that record.

### Programming Changes My Life

#### Day 1304, 05, 06 ChatGPT and Python

On the weekend, I completed a course on using the ChatGPT API with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
The course was offered by deeplearning.ai, a reputable platform.
I gained valuable insights on creating effective prompts and utilizing various features of ChatGPT.
Additionally, I made progress in reading the "Microservice Patterns" book.

#### Day 1303 Learning Pandas

Today I am continuing learning more about pandas, I need to do a basic diagram showing some data using the matplotlib
python library also I learn how to select some date from a pandas dataframe.
I cannot advance in the Microservice Patterns book because I am continuing studying english.

#### Day 1302 Pandas and PySpark

Well, today I continue practicing with pandas and pyspark python libraries.
I need to analyze some CSV files and extract selected data.
Filter data with pyspark is like SQL, but with pandas I believe that is more efficient.
I do the same process with the two libraries, but with pyspark the process takes more time rather than pandas.
Also, saving a dataframe in a new csv is easier with pandas.

#### Day 1301 Pyspark

Today I learned how to read a CSV file using Pyspark and how to filter the rows in the CSV file with a condition.
Tomorrow I will need to investigate what are the differences between Apache Spark and Pyspark.
I can see that if I turn off my Spark Docker container on my local machine, Pyspark continues working without problems,
and this behavior is strange because what Spark process uses the pyspark library.
I do not know the answer to this question, but tomorrow I will review this.
